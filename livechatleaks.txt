--[ 1 - Introduction

Kane Gamble and Cody Zacharias discovered information disclosure vulnerabilities
in live chat software by LiveChat Software (LiveChatInc), TouchCommerce (formerly
inQ, inc. and recently acquired by Nuance Communications), LivePerson, and many
others.

Vendors were notified of security issues present in their live chat software, or
at least contact attempts were made. Vendors mentioned in this paper have not
fixed the vulnerabilities disclosed.

--[ 2 - Information Disclosure

Each live chat software is affected the same way. Significant information about
the employee/agent you're communicating with is detailed in the responses of
POST requests that are made when chatting with the agent. The information 
disclosure bugs in the live chat software exist because there are no steps taken
to prevent information about the person you're chatting with from being mentioned
in the responses.

The type of information being disclosed is dependent on the company/website
using the live chat software. Some examples of information we've seen being
disclosed include:

- Employee's full name
- Employee's supervisor and managers
- Employee's ID
- Employee's supervisor and manager's employee ID
- Employee's location
- Center name
- Employee's email
- Indications of other tools/programs the employee is using

This data can be retrieved by inspecting the requests made during a live
chat session with browser networking tools or Burp Suite.

--[ 3 - Proof of Concept

Parts of each sample have been redacted with ****. 

----[ 3.1 - LiveChat Software (LiveChatInc)

This sample is taken from Google Fiber's live chat. The information being disclosed
include the employee's name and email address belonging to their account. In some
cases, the email address disclosed is a personal email, not a work email address.

----[ 3.2 - TouchCommerce

This sample is taken from Verizon's live chat. The information being disclosed include
the employee's full name, employee ID, supervisor's name, supervisor's EID, managers,
center name and location. There is also indication that the employee is using CoFEE,
a Verizon employee tool used to lookup customer records.

--[ 4 - Business Impact

The type of information being exposed is everything a person would need to successfully
perform social engineering attacks against the company by using an employee's real
information such as their full name, employee ID and supervisor's name to impersonate them.
This could lead to somebody gaining access to employee tools and even allow them to gain a
foothold in the internal network.
